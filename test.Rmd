Before we get started with the motivating dataset, we need to cover the very basics of R.

# 2.2.1 objects
Suppose a high school student asks us for help solving several quadratic equations of the form $$ax^2+bx+c=0.$$ The quadratic formula gives us the solutions:
$${-b-\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}and{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$


```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
